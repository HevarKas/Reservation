      header: "About Me",
      content: "I’m Dr. Hazhaow Murad (Hager), a veterinarian with a Master’s in Veterinary Public Health and a PhD in Food Hygiene and Quality Control from Iraq. With over 20 years of experience in food safety and health consultancy, I have dedicated my career to understanding the critical role of food in promoting health. Additionally, I hold diplomas in Human Nutrition from Egypt and Alison, reinforcing my commitment to holistic wellness. My previous academic journey as a university instructor, along with managing my clinic in Iraq and working as a hygiene passport trainer in Finland, has provided me the opportunity to lead numerous workshops and training sessions for veterinarians, food inspectors, food workers, and business professionals. These experiences have helped me develop strong teaching abilities and sharpen my skills in delivering effective guidance."

    vision: {
      header: "My Vision",
      content: "Throughout my career as a food hygiene and safety specialist, I have come to believe that the stomach is the root of most diseases—when you treat it poorly, it treats you worse. This is why making smart food choices is crucial to overall health. Over the years, I have seen firsthand how food safety and quality impact general well-being. Poor nutritional habits and unsafe food handling can wreak havoc on health, but with the right guidance, adjustments in diet, and food safety practices, many health issues can be prevented or reversed. I have helped many people recover from serious conditions and health concerns simply by adjusting their eating habits and making more informed food choices. I am here to guide you on the path to a healthier life. My approach combines modern food safety principles with natural, food-based remedies, as I believe healing starts with what we eat. After all, 'from ash we came, and to ash we shall return.' Better food, better health, better life."
